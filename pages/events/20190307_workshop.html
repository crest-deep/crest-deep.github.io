    <h1>DL2.0 Unit, I2R-TokyoTech Co-workshop on Deep Learning</h1>
    <p>
        This workshop focuses on topics that accelerate state of the art deep learning algorithms with the aim of large GPU clusters (e.g., 4000 GPUs). Specifically, the speakers will introduce second-order methods that enable fast and parallel training of deep neural networks and how they can be applied to accelerate HE and GANs. We will also discuss other topics that are closely related to DL2.0’s roadmap, including learning with less data, hardware implementation of deep networks, model compression and so on.

                <br>
                As the size of deep neural networks and the data they consume grow rapidly, it is becoming increasingly important to parallelize their training. Computing on massively parallel computers forces the optimization algorithms for deep learning to operate in a regime they were not originally designed for. Stochastic gradient descent relies on the mini-batches being small in order to generalize well to data it was not trained on. The increase in parallel processes leads to an increase in the batch size and deprives the SGD of the stochasticity necessary for the generalization. In this regime, techniques such as batch normalization also behave very differently, and initialization and normalization of the weights and regularization of the loss become more important than before. We show that when enough care is taken for the initialization, normalization, and regularization, second order optimization methods start to show their inherent advantage over first order methods.

            Recent studies on robustness of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) shows that CNNs are highly vulnerable towards adversarial attacks. Meanwhile, smaller sized CNN models with no significant accuracy loss are being introduced to mobile devices. However, only the accuracy on standard datasets is reported along with such research. The wide deployment of smaller models on millions of mobile devices stresses importance of their robustness. In this research, we study how robust such models are with respect to state-of-the-art compression techniques such as quantization. Our contributions include: (1) insights to achieve smaller models and robust models (2) a compression framework which is adversarial-aware. In the former, we discovered that compressed models are naturally more robust than compact models. This provides an incentive to perform compression rather than designing compact models. Additionally, the latter provides benefits of increased accuracy and higher compression rate, up to 90x.</td>

                    <br>
                    <br>In this talk, we talk about generalization error analysis of deep
                    learning and its application to a model compression problem for deep neural network models. The generalization analysis is based on the eigenvalue distribution of the kernel functions defined in the internal layers. Based on the analysis, we develop a simple compression algorithm for the neural network which is applicable to wide range of network models. Moreover, we also introduce a functional gradient method for constructing ResNet-type neural network.

                    <br>We conduct a software architecture study for several popular deep learning (DL) frameworks and low-level deep learning primitives libraries to estimate their portability to future hardware platforms. The main target is the Post-K, exa-scale class supercomputer to be deployed in Japan by 2021. It is based on A64FX CPUs with extended ARM instruction set. We try, however, to make our analysis as generic as possible for it to be useful for other hardware architectures.
